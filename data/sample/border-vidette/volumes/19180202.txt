W. R. Weems of Winslow rais
ed three tons ot beans on his
ranch adjoining the government
reserve the past year, and still
the government insists that land
of this character must be keot
within the forest reserve and
not thrown open to settlement.
Two years ago B. A. Fowler
sold his ranch northwest of
Phoenix for 50,000. Recently
C. R. Green of Phoenix bought
the ranch for 80,000. That in
brief, is the story of the pro
gress made by the Salt River
valley during tne last two years.
Every boy who serves his
country either in the navy or
army should take out an army
insurance policy. The govern
ment has arranged such so that
no man returning from the 'ser
vice need be a dependant, but be
independent. And, every boy
should take out the $10,000 po
licy. That sum is not one cent
too much for a life given for the
sake of war.

of the student body of the Un

Mr. Wallace is a graduate of
that institution, having graduat

necessary to hold a special elec

In view of the fact that Gov
ernor Hunt is contemplating
calling a special session of the
legislature, the Congregational
church at a business meeting
last evening passed a vote that
it was the sense of the church
that if the Governor calls a spe

in his call the ratification of the
prohibition amendment of the
federal constitution. Such vote
has been communicated to the
Governor. Prospector.

quently visited here and his
friends are glad to hear of his
promotion. Captain White is the
son of Dr. White, who came to
Arizona many years ago. Capt.
White received his education at

highway for the
purpose of arriving at an estim

ments were made this week by
State Engineer Lamar Cobb fol
lowing a conference" with the
members ot the Pinal county
board of supervisors, and Post
master Jones of Superior. The
new connecting link will leave
the Roosevelt highway at a
point about thirteen miles east

Arizd-na Indian Appropriations.
The Indian Appropriation Bill
which has passed the House,
authorizes the expenditure of
over $1,000,000 for the benefit of
the red skinned wards of the
Government in Arizona. The
The customary appropriations
for their support and civilization
amounting to $200,000 were made
and the maintenance of the Ari
zona schools was provided for at
a cost of $250,000
Congressman .Hayden was
again successful in obtaining
funds to continue the Indian
irrigation enterprises in his
State. $50,000 additional will be
available toward the construc
tion of the main canal leading
from the diversion dam on the
Gila River above Florence, the
limit of cost of the dam and
brid.ge across that stream near
Sacaton was increased by a like
amount, and $20,000 was added
for new work on the Ganado
project in Apache county.
An amendment offered by Mr.
Hayden was agreed to which
provides that $50,000 derived
from the sale of town lots at
Parker shall Be expended in sur
veys and estimates for a com
plete irrigation system to supply
water to the tillable lands on the
Colorado River Reservation.
These lots were sold by the Gov
ernment with the understanding
that the Indian lands near Park
er wcmld be irrigated and open
ed to settlement, so that high
prices were paid for them. In
urging the use of this money as
the beginning of a large Federal
irrigation project the represent
ative from Arizona said:
"Nothing has been done look
ing to the opening of the Reser
vation and many of the people
who invested their money have
lost it. If some private real
estate company had advertised
and sold lots in this manner, its
officers would have been con
victed of obtaining money under
false pretenses in violation of
the 'Blue Sky' law of Arizona."
Another new item in the Bill
is an appropriation of $10,000
to construct a drift fence along
the international boundary in
Pima county to prevent cattle,
belonging to the Papago In
dians, from straying into Mex
ico. $20,000 is also set aside for
drilling wells on the Papage Re

REGISTERING ALIENS.
Are Not to Be Treated as Persons of
Evil Disposition.
Postmaster Selim J. Michel- j
son, of Phoenix, has been ap
pointed chief registrar for the
entire state of Arizona, with the
exception of Phoenix, Tucson,
Douglas, Bisbee, Prescott and
Globe in which cities the chief
of police will register the Ger
man alien enemies. In all other
cities and towns the postmaster
is an assistant registrar, send
ing all registrations to the Phoe
nix postmaster.
The registration of all German
aliens will take place through
out the entire United States be
ginning on February 4, and con
tinuing to the evening of Febru
ary 9. In the six above men
tioned cities the registrations
will be made by the chiefs of
police and in all other sections
of the state German aliens must
register at the postoffice where
they receive their mail.
This registration applies to
every native, citizen, denizen or
subject of trie German Empire
or of the Imperial government,
who are males 14 years old or
over, within the United States
and not actually naturalized as
an American citizen. An alien
enemy who fails to register, in
addition to all other penalties
prescribed by law, is liable to
restraint imprisonment and de
tention for the duration of the
war.
The attorney general has call
ed Chief Bailey's attention to
the following section:
"13. All registration officers
are reminded that many regis
trants will need assistance and
advice in filling out their regis
tration affidavits and they are
requested to aid such persons in
every proper way. Registrants
are not to be treated as persons
of evil disposition, and the regis
tration officers are urged to deal
with them in a courteous and
friendly manner."
Attention is also called to the
fact that under no circumstances
shall fees be charged or gratui
ties accepted from registrants
for administering oaths or for
any other reason. Tucson Citi
zen. The S. P. Selling Thrift Stamps.
The same machinery which
proved so effective in the sale of
Liberty Bonds has been placed
by the Southern Pacific Com
pany at the disposal of Uncle
Sam in the campaign to sell "W.
S. S." War Saving Stamps.
One hundred Southern Pacific
stations along the Pacific Sys
tem now are authorized to sell
thrift stamps and the company
has a preliminary consignment
of $10,000 worth. The man from
whom you buy your railroad
ticket can sell you a thrift stamp
with every railroad ticket, or
you take your change in thrift
stamps, which amount to the
same thing. Sixteen thrift
stamps at 25c each, representing
a value of $4.00 may be exchang
ed for a War Savings certificate
for an additional cost of 13 cents
in January and 1 cent additional
for each succeeding month.
The Government will redeem
these certificates in 1923 for $5.00
each, and in the meantime they
are convertible into cash at any
postoffice.
HAYDEN IS ALL RIGHT.
Congressman Carl Hayden, by
his votes in congress, is evident
ly trying to represent his Ari
zona constituents. He has voted
regularly in favor of every bill
looking for national prohibition,
has always voted steadfastly for
every woman's suffrage bill, and
has been religiously voting for
every war measure proposed by
the administration. And he does
this without making speeches to
the gallery. Winslow Mail.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
(Santa Cruz Patagonian)
The Castle Butte has suspend
ed sinking operations, and is
now drifting on the ledge of
high grade copper ore to deter
mine its size.
The new school house at the
3 R camp is reported completed
and ready for use." The teacher
for the school started on her
duties Monday morning.
Mr. John Hoy, superintendent
of the Trench mine, is in Los
Angeles on business connected
with the company, and is ex
pected back this afternoon.
Mr. H. F. Scheerer of the
Castle Butte mine returned Mon
day from Tucson, where ha has
been for several days on busi
ness connected with the prop
erty. Charles Witting of Bisbee is
here to arrange the work neces
sary for the development of the
Exposed Reef mine, which was
recently taken over by Bisbee
parties.
The Blue Eagle mine is being
nn watered, preparatory to be
ginning development work. This
is one of the properties taken
over by Mr. Shaw and associates
of California. It is located in
Alum Gulch.
At the Viceroy mine, neai Sa
lero, Mr. Howard Baack, in
charge of the work, reports that
a vein of argentite 16 inches
wide has been struck that assays
600 ounces in silver and 9 per
cent copper. This is a good
prospect and much work has
been done on it in the last sev
eral months.
Mr. and Mrs. James Ritchie
and children were in from the
Arizona-European mine Tuesday
evening. Mr. Ritchie is super
intendent of this excellent prop
erty, and reports the mine as
having a good opporttmity to
become a paying mine from now
on. They have a 60-ton car of
high grade ore ready for ship
ment, and more will follow as
soon as it can be gotten ready.
The mine now is employing
about 14 men.
The lectures and moving pict
ures at the opera house last
Friday and Saturday were not
attended by as many people as
should have gone to hear and
see the instructive demonstra
tion of first aid lessons. The
University of Arizona bureau of
mines is doing a great and good
work for the miners of the state,
and it should be encouraged by
those who receive the most ben
efit, at least to the extent of
trying to make these lectures,
which will be a permanent part
of. the bureau's work, a success.
A GOOD APPOINTMENT.
The appointment of Mrs. Bet
tie White of thi3 city on the
board of regents of the state
university by Governor Hunt,
will be gratifying to many
friends of Mrs. White in Doug
las. Since coming to Douglas
Mrs. White has been prominent
in many public efforts here
which were for the benefit of
both men and women and the
government. She has been a
prominent suffrage worker for
many years, though she had no
sympathy with those Bolsheviki
suffragists who assailed every
democrat from President Wilson
to Congressman Hayden in the
last campaign; Mrs. White has
also been a consistent worker
for temperance and prohibition
both here and in the state of
Texas from whence she came to
this city. She is a democrat and
one who has done hard work for
the party. It may be depended
on that Mrs. White will be faith
ful to the university and do all
in her power to keep its effi
ciency up to the present high
standard. International.

ing given over to pleasure arid

of the association and it is deem
ed more than likely that several
resolutions will be adopted bear
ing on this matter. Also stock
driveways and the opening up
of the new feed grounds for
marketing Arizona rango stock
are on the program.
The officers of the Arizona
Cattle Growers' Association are

of the association are in Phoenix.
HEALTH OFFICER'S WARNING
Last Tuesday Dr. Gustetter,
town health officer, issued the
following proclamation, which
is self explanatory:
"Nogales is at present suffer
ing from a severe epidemic of
whooping cough and some of
the cases which affected small
children have resulted fatally.
For this reason I desire to call
the attention of the parents of
very small children especially,
that there is a Prophylactic Vac
cine against whooping cough
just as there is against typhoid
fever, smallpox and diptheria.
This can be administered by ny
of the physicians in town and
will prevent the children from
going through an unnecessary
long siege of severe coughiDg
with its attendant serious com
plications which often super
vine. "In previous years whooping
cough was looked upon as a ne
cessary disease in infancy and
childhood and was not consider
ed a serious disease, but this
has all been changed in later
years and one should no more
think of exposing their child to
whooping cough upon this basis,
any more than they should de
sire their child to be exposed to
smallpox.
"Parents of children suffering
from whooping cough, are pro
hibited from sending their child
ren to school or to any public
places. The picture shows will
also be instructed to prohibit
children suffering with whoop
ing cough from remaining in
their theatres. It is hoped that
we will have che co-operation of
all the people in endeavoring
to eradicate this unnecessary
disease"."

"NOT GUILTY."
Last Tuesday in the Superior
Court, the case of the" State vs.
J. W. Archer and R. R. Red
wine, accused in the complaint
of having stolen a certain white
face cow, of uncertain age, from
Cal Wright and others, was
tried. After being out about ten
minutes, the jury returned with
a verdict of "Not guilty."
The State was represented by
Judge W. L. Barnum, attorney
for the Arizona Cattle Sanitary
Board, and the defence was con
ducted by Duffy & Purdum of
Nogales.
At the time the alleged crime
was committed, "somewhere" in
Santa Cruz county, Redvvine was
running a passenger train be
tween Tucson and El Paso, and
his partner, Archer, was on the
Lordsburg run.
Later Archer sold his inter
est in the herd of cattle purchas
ed from Wright, to Redwine,
who has a valuable cow ranch
near Tubac.
Archer is a deputy sheriff in
Pima county.

ly improved in his section, with
nice rains to help the farmer,

pecting a visit from Mr. Conard
and a number eastern capitalists
who are interested in the company.

FACE the FACTS
LET us face the facts. The war situation is critical.
Unless the Allies fight as they never yet have
fought, defeat threatens. Hungry men cannot fight
at their best; nor hungry nations. France, England,
and Italy are going hungry unless we feed them.
Wheat Savings They must have wheat. It is the
best food to fight on. It is the easiest to ship. We
alone can spare it to them. By saving just a little
less than a quarter of what we ate last yea2- we can
support those who are fighting our battles. And we
can do it without stinting ourselves. We have only
to substitute another food just as good.
The Corn of Plenty Corn is that food. There's a
surplus of it. Providence has been generous in the
hour of our need. It has given us corn in such bounty
as was never known before. Tons of corn. Train
loads of corn. Five hundred million bushels over and
above our regular needs. All we have to do is to
learn to appreciate it. Was ever patriotic duty made
so easy? And so clear?
America's Own Food Corn! It is the true American
food. The Indians, hardiest of races, lived on it.
Our forefathers adopted the diet and conquered a
continent. For a great section of our country it
has blong een the staff of life. How Well the South
fought on it, history tells. Now it can help America
win a world war.
Learn Something Corn! It isn't one food. It's a
dozen. It's a cereal. It's a vegetable. It's a bread.
It's a dessert. It's nutritious; more food value in it,
dollar for dollar, than meat or eggs or most other
vegetables. It's good to eat; how good you don't
know until you've had corn-bread properly cooked.
Best of all, it's plentiful and it's patriotic.
Corn's Infinite Variety How much do you know about
corn? About how good it is? About the many
delicious ways of cooking it? And what you mis3
by not knowing more about it? Here are a few
of its uses:
There are at least fifty ways to use corn meal to
make good dishes for dinner, supper, lunch or break
fast. Here are some suggestions:
DESSERTS
Corn-meal molasses cake.
Apple corn bread.
Dumplings.
Gingerbread.
Fruit gems.
HOT BREADS
Boston brown bread.
Hoecake.
Muffins.
Biscuits.
Griddle cakes.
Waffles.
HEARTY DISHES
Corn-meal croquettes. Corn-meal fish balls.
Meat and corn-meal dumplings.
Italian polenta. Tamales.

was highly recommended for this
trouble. I began taking it. I felt
better after a few doses. My appetite
improved and I became stronger. My
bowels acted naturally and the least
