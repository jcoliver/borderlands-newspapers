Commission is pleased to an
nounce that the development of
this valuable State Institute has
been accomplished by the aid of
each County and their respective
citizens willing to Do Their Bit,

Fair Commission that each
County, if possible, out do its

To itemize the multitude of
varied attractions that go to

entire Southwest.
Let us each one Do Our Bit."

STRINGENT PASSPORT LAW.
LIBERTY LOAN INTEREST RATE
Secretary McAdoo has defi
nitely announced that the 4th
Liberty Loan bonds will bear
4j per cent interest.
The secretary has been insist
ent that the government interest
rate should be stabilized at 44
per cent. He points out that a
raise iu the rate of interest of
only one fourth of 1 per cent on
$10,000,000,000 of government
bonds would mean an annual in
crease of $23,000,000 in interest
charges, and that this money
would have to be raised by in
creased taxation and paid by the
people of the country. It would
not be paid by one class only,
because there are consumption
as well as other kind of taxes,
and the consumption taxes reach
every class of people.
"As an intelligent people,"
said Secretary McAdoo during
the Third Liberty Loan cam
paign," we should now make a
stand for the financing of our
government during the period of
this war at a stabilized rate of
interest, say at 4 per cent per
annum, so that all business and
and all investments may be ad
justed to that basis, and so that
we ourselves may protect our
selves against successively in
creased rates of interest on gov
ernment loans."
Neither our patriotism nor our
support of the Liberty Loans
are measured in fractions of per
cent.
Arizona Gets 850,000 Lbs. of Sugar
Mr. A. S. Northrup, special
agent at Nogales for the De
partment of Justice, has called
the attention of The Oasis to
the new regulation of grant
ing passports.
The law is to take effect on
September 15th, as set forth in
the presidential proclamation
promulgating it.
The particulars and forceful
paragraphs are Section 2 and a
part of Section 3. as follows:
"Sec. 2. After such procla
mation as is provided for by the
preceding section has been made
and published and while said
proclamation is in force, it shall,
except as otherwise provided by
the President, be unlawful for
any citizen of the United States,
to depart from or enter or at
tempt to depart from or enter
from or enter the United States
unless he bears a valid pass
port."
Section 3 provides a penalty
or tine and imprisonment for
any violation of the act, which
fine may be as much as $10,000,
and the imprisonment can be as
long as twenty years.
That will make it impossible
for any citizen who leaves the
United States to escape regis
tration and draft under the new
law to return to his country at
any time. He cannot return
without a valid passport, and no
passports will be given to such
people.
And if any of them come with
out passports they will face a
fine and imprisonment that will
be tremendous. Oasis.
WOMEN ARE WANTED.
The Arizona chapter of the
American Red Cross with head
quarters in Phoenix, has been
advised that orders have been
received from Paris headquart
ers to enroll 300 women motor
drivers for overseas service.
Arizona women who are inter
ested in this announcement can
secure further information in
the War Work building, at Phoe
nix, Arizona.
The Pacific division is asked
to furnish a quota of 25 of this
number and applications are be
ing received at the bureau of
personnel in division headquart
ers, Flood building, San Fran
cisco. The mere knowledge of
driving does not qualify appli
cants for this service. Mechan
ical knowledge, driving tests,
physical examinations, general
type and adaptability to military
routine are carefully considered,
together with licenses. In ad
dition to this, training in first
aid is necessary. Various chap
ters throughout the Pacific di
vision are organizing motor
corps as an adjunct to their local
service.
The September allotment of
sugar for Arizona will be 850,000
pounds as compared to 750,000
pounds for August, according to
a wire received here from the
the food administration at Wash
ington. All county food administrators
were notified of the allotments
for their counties, which are as
follows:
Apache county, 20,842 pounds
Cochise county 100,900.
Coconino, 30155.
Gila, 90,902.
Graham, 25,432.
Greelee, 57,270.
Maricopa, 135,530.
Mohave, 21,242.
Navajo, 30,378.
Pinal, 48,118.
Santa Cruz, 27,950.
Yavapai, 03,019.
Yuma, 34,830.
The above allottments are
based on population estimates
furnished by the county food ad
ujiuistrators.
OUR EXPORTS OF SILVER.
The melting down of the sil
ver dollars in the United States
Treasury and the exportation of
the bar silver resulting and other
silver bullion possess great in
terest to the average American
citizen.
Most of this silver bullion is
sent to India, whose people have
a strong prejudice in favor of
metal money, and India is ex
porting a vast amount of mater
ial used in the war by England
and France, and, in fact, all the
entente allies, including our
selves. To pay for these goods in the
money desired by the people of
India caused a tremendous drain
on the supply of silver of en
tente allies, and to meet this
urgent demand the United States
has taken the great amount of
silver bullion and silver dollars
lying idle in its treasury and is
exporting it to India to be used
in paying for war supplies.
Something like a hundred mil
lion silver dollars have beeu
melted down and exported.
What great assistance it was
to the allies, including the U. S.
is shown by the stateir.ent of
Sir James Meston, financial
member of the Viceroy's Coun
cil, who is reported assaying:
"Probably few people in Am
erica realize how vitally im
portant to India and to India's
share in the war was the legis
lation passed in Washington re
leasing large quantities of silver
for use in alleviating the cur
rency situation there. For this
action India as well as the Brit
ish Empire and the allies owe a
debt of gratitude to the United (
States which it is hard to over I
state."

State Wins Baca Float Tax Case. .
The Arizona State tax com
mission and the county of Santa
Cruz have obtained a decision in
the famous Baca Float No. 3
case handed down recently by
Judge Pattee of the Superior
Court of Pima county, who tried
the case.
This was a suit brought to re
cover back taxes alleged to be
due the state of Arizona for the
the years 1913, 1914, 1915 and
1910. The Baca Float No. 3
contains 100, OOO and was assess
ed for $1,000,000. The court of
last resort in 1915 determined
that the Baca Float No. 3 be
longed to the Baca heirs and
that title passed in 180H. The
total amount of taxes involved
was about.
The owners of the iloat con
tended that the pssessment was
excessive and that in the years
1913 and 1914 the property was
not taxable because title had not
yet been adjudicated and that
the taxes for the years 1915 and
1910 were void because the prop
erty was held in two parts, but
was assessed as a whole, and for
that reason the owners for either
part did not know what their
taxes amounted to.
The court held that the taxes
on the valuation assessed should
be paid for the years 1915 and
1910, and that the fact of separ
ate ownership of the two strips
did not effect the validity of the
tax. but that for the years 1913
and 1914 they were not taxable,
because the lands were not se
gregated from the public domain
so as to render them susceptible
to taxation.
It also was held by the court
in the decision that the statute
that reri aires the payment of the
taxes as a condition precedent
to a defense or on action for re
covery where the taxes apply
to propei ty subject to taxation
is valid. Prospector.
In a petition containing the
names of 2,100 workers in the
copper mines and smelters of
the Miami district and filed with
the state corporation complaint
is made concerning the water
and electric light service rates.
Five water companies operating
in that district are cited in the
complaint and also the city of
Miami. An investigation by the
corporation commission is asked
Learn to Get Along Without Sugar
It has been done before. A hundred years ago re
fined sugar was unknown. Our ancestors used honey and
you can use honey also. Besides there are syrups. The
natural sugars of fruits will serve today as they did cen
turies ago. You will get all the sugar you need in this
way. The Allies do it now. England, which before the
war used more sugar than we did, has but two pounds
per head a month now; France one and a half pounds,
and Italy only one. Show yourself a patriotic American
and use less than your ration. This is but a slight sacri
fice as compared with all that the Allies are doing. Do it
yourself.

Out of fourteen counties in the

Yuma county eoing for Osborn
by a small majority.
The vote in Santa Cruz county
was very light, especially in No
gales, where only 260 votes were
cast out of a possible 900 regis
tered votes. In all the precincts
heard from Colter led his two
opponents, as did Hon. A. C.
Baker for judge of the supreme
court, Wylie E. Jones for attor
ney general, Mit Sims, for sec
retary of state, and G. H. Bolin,
for mine inspector.
The contest between Messrs.
Northcraft, Finley and Ashburn,
for supervisor, resulted in the
nomination of O. F. Ashburn of
Patagonia and James L. Finley
of Canille.
Only a small vote was cast by
the Republicans, owing to the
fact that none of their candi
dates for nomination, had oppo

The nominees of the Repub

TO ARIZONA DEMOCRATS
Phoenix, Ariz., Sept. 11, 1918.
Editor The Border Vidette:
Until I have an opportunity to
personally acknowledge the con
gratulations and good wishes
that have been reaching me to
day, I am taking the liberty of
the press to express the grati
tude I feel to the voters of the
state for the honor they have
conferred upon me.
Everyone who has followed
my campaign and the results
justify me in believing there are
quite a number must know that
I have a very keen sense of the
responsibility that has been
placed upon me. My one plea
to the people has been that it is
absolutely vital for every citizen
to take a keen personal interest
in politics or government. By
nominating me, I believe the
people have signified that they
are absolutely alive to their per
sonal responsibility and believe
that to the extent of my power
and ability I will represent all
the people. That above all I
shall try to accomplish, and be
lieve I have so conducted my
primary campaign that it will be
possible for every voter to give
me whole hearted support en
tirely regardless of previous
afttiations. At least that has
been my aim, and reinforced by
success I shall even more firmly
if that is possible insist that
the campaign for the general
election be conducted in accord
ance with the traditions worthy
of our party and with malice to
none.
I find no ill faeling in my heart
for either of my opponents nor
any of their supporters and I
will use every effort within my
power to create harmony in the
party and establish a better un
derstanding between capital and
labor. We can then with united
and intense action more quickly
win the war.
I have never claimed a greater
loyalty than that possessed by
any tried and true American,
but I do claim that at this time
we can best show our loyalty by
our undivided support of the de
mocracy of President Wilson.
And on that democracy I stand,
and ask for support as the can
didate of an undivided demo
cracy in Arizona. I shall have
more to say later but today find
it impossible to say more than
"Thank you."
Fred. T. Colter.
R. A. Lehrke, manager of the
Broadway Store, Inc., has re
turned from the eastern markets,
where he purchased fall and

OPENING OF SCHOOL.
' Timely Suggestions by Superintendent
Madden to Parents and Children.
The 1918 1919 session of the
Nogales Public Schools will be
gin next-Monday morning, Sept.
10. Parents should see that
their children report promptly
at nine o'clock. After the en
rollment is taken pupils will be
allowed to return home and
should report again Tuesday
morning for work.
The need for educalion and
scientifically trained men was
never greater th?n now. If the
war lasts long the need will be
greater. When the war is over
the; days of reconstruction will
call heavily on this country for
trained and skilled men. Be
cause of the scarcity of common
labor many of the young boys
of the community will be tempt
ed to go to work. But we must
not. forget that if the boys quit
school now and works he, per
haps, will never take up his
school life again and will be
found wanting when the big call
comes for trained men. Another
thing we should keep in mind.
When the war is over and the
boys come back fiom the front
they will take precedence over
the young fellows who did not
go to war. This means that the
ex soldier rightly will take the
job and crowd the other fellow
out. Unless a boy possesses
special knowledge or training
for some line of work he cannot
j compete with the ex soldier.
It is not amiss at this time to
! notify employers that in em
ploying boys during school hours
they should see that these boys
are over school age or have per
mission to work. The law holds
both employer and parent re
sponsible for violations of this
kind.
In order that our children may
receive the best services from
the teachers employed we must
see that our teachers are happy
and contented. One of the first
requisites to contentment is a
good home to live in. We can
not except our teachers most of
whom come from the best fami
lies in their own communities,
to come to Nogales and put up
with poor living conditions and
do their best work at school.
Families having a room to spare
should take one or more of the
teachers. If such families will
list with me any rooms they
may have to rent teachers will
be directed to them.

50-50 RULING BANNNED
CONSUMPTION OF CORN BREAD
URGED AS ESSENTIAL
TO CONSERVATION.
Sweeping changes in all wheat con
servation regulations are made in the
new wheat-saving program of the
United States food administration ef
fective September 1, the details of
which have just been announced by
the federal food administrator for Ari
zona. The six-pound per person per mouth
allowance, the ration card system and
the purchase of flour on a fifty-fifty
basis with substitutes have all been
swept aside by the new plan which
calls for the mixing of 20 per cent
substitutes in wheat flour in Ihe man
ufacture. Until this new "Victory"
flour is on the market present stocks
of standard wheat flour will be sold
in combination with substitutes in the
proportion of four pounds of wheat
flour to one of substitutes.
Though the wheat regulations are
relaxed to a great extent by the new
program the food administration wish
es to emphasize the fact that strict
economy in the use of ail wheat pro
ducts is still necessary and the public
is expected to continue in the con
sumption of corn bread to the same
extent as formerly. If this is done it
is felt that it will not be necessary for
some time to resort to the drastic reg
ulations which have been In effect
for the past several months.
Hoover Explains.
The reasons for inaugurating a new
wheat program are explained by Her
bert Hoover as follows:
"The recent careful survey by the
food administrators of the T'nited
States, France, England and Itaiy of
the food resources of the 220,000,000
people fighting against Germany,
shows that to maintain enough sup
plies and necessary reserves against

'disaster, thee niust be maintained in
all count; ies a conservation of wheat
flour during the coming year.
"It hr.s been agreed that the wheat
broad ot the allies shall contain 20
per ceni of other grains than wheat
and it is only Just that we should
bear our share in tins saving and that
our bread at least, should be universal
with those who are suffering more
greatly from t!ie war than ourselves.
"Distribution and transportation cir
cumstar.ee:; in the United States ren
der it necessary to rely very largely
on the voluntary action of our homes
to enforce tills mixture. The Victory
bread, so made, is wholesome, and
there is no difficulty in preparation.
We desire to emphasize the fact that
the mixtures proposed are for wheat
bread and the saving of wheat flour,
but they are not intended to displace
the large use of corn bread: we must
use the mixture with wheat flour in
;add1tion to our normal consumption of
corn bread."
New Regulations.
New regulations have been promul
gated governing manufacturers in the
production of new Victory flours.
These call for a mixture of four
pounds of wheat flour with one pound
either of barley flour or corn flour or
of eight pounds of wheat flour with one
pound each of corn flour and barley
flour. Rve may be mixed with the
wheat in the proportion of two pounds
of rye flour to three of wheat flour.
Whole wheat and graham flour must
contain at least 9r per cent of the
wheat berry.
All of the above Victory flours may
be sold without substitutes but at no
greater price from ihe milier. whole
saler or retail dealer than in the case
of standard wheat flour.
Affecting Retailers.
New regulations superseding the fifty-fifty
rule require that the retail
dealer selling standard wheat flour
shall carry in stock either barley
flour, corn flour or corn meal and with
all sales of straight flour must sell
one pound of these with every four
pounds of wheat flour. The dealer is
not permitted to force oilier substi
tutes in combination upon the con

CALLED HER FAMILY
TO HER BEDSIDE
Six Years Ago, Thinking She Might Die, Says Texas Lady, But Now
She Is a Well, Strong Woman and Praises Cardui For
Her Recovery.
Royse City, Tex. Mrs. I.Tary Kil-
man, of this place, says; "After the
birth of my little girl... my side com
menced to hurt me. I had to go back
to bed. We called the doctor. He
treated me. . .hut I got no better. I
got worse and worse until the misery
was unbearable. . .1 was in hed for
three months and suffered such agony
that I was just drawn up in a knot. . .
I told my husband if he would get
oie a bottle of Cardui I would try it. . .
commenced taking it, however, that
evening I called my family about
ne... for I knew I could not last
many days unfcss I had a chansa for
the better. That was Bis years ago
and I am still here and am a well,
strong woman, and I owe my life to
Cardui. I had only taken half the
bottle when I began to feel better.
The misery in my side got less... I
continued right on taking the Cardui
until I had taken thiee bottles and I
did not need any more for I was well
and never felt better in my life... I
have never had any trouble from that
day to this."
Do you suffer from headache, back
ache, pains to sides, or other discom
forts, each month? Or do you feel
weak, nervous and fagged-out? If bo,
give Cardui, the woman's tonic, a
trial. J. 71
