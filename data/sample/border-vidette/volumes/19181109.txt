LIVELIEST MINING CAMP IN THE
STATE; STEADILY GROWING.
Patagonia is now coming into
its own as far as mines is con
cerned. The 3 R mill is handling a ton
nage of 200 tons a day and is
keeping the teams busy hauling.
C. B. Wilson will soon have his
truck back on the haul, which
will relieve the present conges
tion of concentrates at the mill.
The Flux mill is operating two
shifts and as soon as labor can
be obtained will be working 24
hours daily. Its new pipeline
for water is completed and in
operation, which allows it to
operate its flotation plant suc
cessfully. It is a most gratify
ing sight to see a local mill
treating a lead carbonate ore in
such an efficient manner. It is
doubtful whether there is a mill
treating a carbonate ore body
anywhere and obtaining a better
extraction than is the mill at the
Flux.
The new Word's Fair mill
"raised its colors" this week and
is "on the firing line" in earnest.
While it usually requires con
siderable time to get a new mill
tuned up to successful operation,
the World's Fair mill is working
satisfactorily and the operators
are delivering concentrates at a
rapidly increasing rate. This is
the most complete mill in the
Patagonia district.
The Hardshell mill is again
operating after a shut down for
repairs. The mill is cleaning a
manganese ore, and since the
shut-down has been making an
excellent grade of manganese
concentrates. The pulp is being
both tabled and jigged.
The Morning Glory mine has
shipped two carloads of copper
ores and is getting the red metal
out in a most satisfactory man
ner. An air compressor is be
ing installed at the main tunnel
portal. The main tunnel was
driven under the mountain about
400 feet by the owner, C. B. Wil
son, and when this tunnel is ad
vanced into the mineralized area
great things are expected from
this property. The present oper
ator is the Southern Arizona
Mining and Smelting Company,
which is equipping the property
for successful work and has
erected a modern camp.
The Venderwalker brothers,
operating the Bull Whacker
property, have entered into a
contract for a large tonnage of
manganese ore and are now min
ing the manganese stopes.
It is understood that the Santa
Cruz Syndicate, operating the
mineral rights on the Baca Float
grant, have two carloads of high
grade ore ready for shipment,
and that Patagonia soon will
have a look at this fine ore.
Messrs. Neil and John Mc
Donald with Harry Ismond are
working the Hosey property.
They are working in a good
grade of ore and will soon be
sending the rock to the railroad
for shipment.
Churn drilling at the property
of the Ruby Copper Company is
progressing satisfactorily.
The parties operating the Ex
posed Reef mines have complet
ed the building of a road up
Alumn Gulch and will soon have
the property equipped and a
shaft collared. They anticipate
sinking a 300 foot vertical work
shaft, and it is such shafts that
the district needs. The work is
being done under the direction
of Dan Dawson, a practical min
er of much experience. Pata
gonian. QUARANTINE MODIFIED.
The following instructions
have been issued by County
Physician W. F. Chenoweth:
"As the inlluenza epidemic
will probably persist throughout
the winter, it becomes impera
tive that restrictions against
schools and public gatherings
will be lifted, and if all the peo
ple of the community will give
their full cooperation, we can
continue to have comparative
immunity.
"As soon as the proper blanks
have been printed and posted,
and the measures to be adopted
have been sufficiently advertis
ed, a recommendation that said
restrictions be removed will be
made. '
"Those ill with any disease
resembling inlluenza will be re
quired to remain indoors until
well and the house placarded
'influenza.'
"Each physician or other in
dividual knowing of the pre
sence of a case of influenza or
any other disease that resembles
it, must obtain one of these post
ers and see that the house is
placarded, 'influenza.'
"All school teachers are here
by instructed to immediately
send home any children that
have bad colds, sore throat,
hoarseuess, fever or other sick
ness that may be suspicious;
said teachers must give a poster
to the child with orders that
same be used as above indicat
ed, and give instructions that
said child must not return to
school until well.
"Business men, managers of
theaters, etc., should see that
these instructions are fully car
ried out.
"These measures are not so
effective as the ones now in
force, but if cooperation is given
freely it will be sufficient, other
wise the restrictions will again
become effective."
LIEUTENANT COLONEL GILLAM
Yesterday Mrs. Van C. Gillam
nee Virginia Harrison, wife of a
gentleman known well in Noga
les, who was a lieutenant in the
Twelfth Infantry when that re
giment came here some three
years ago, received a telegram
conveying the pleasing informa
tion that her husband had been
advanced another grade in the
army, and he is now Lieutenant
Colonel Gillam.
Everyone here will feel great
interest in this nromotion, not
only because the young officer
is known so well here, and be
cause he married one of the
fairest of Nogales' daughters
but also because he may be
claimed as an Arizonan, as he
attended the University of Ari
zona, and received there a part
of his military instruction.

NEW PASSPORT RULING.
Inspector in Charge A. J. Mil
liken of the Immigration Service
says that a new ruling has been
made that will permit many peo
pie residing in Mexico to cross
the line to do shopping. Per
sons coming across the line for
that purpose will be permitted
to stay not less than four days
nor more than thirty days.
Heretofore people living in Mex
ico were allowed to remain in
this country to do shopping but
two days and under the rule of
September 15th it was necessary
for them to have a border pass
port. Under the new order the
border permit will be no longer
required.
Passports in use before Sept
ember 15th may be used by trav
elers between the two countries
if properly visid by United
States consuls in Mexico and
advanced to date. Oasis.

UNCLE SAM'S
ADVICE ON FLU
U. S. Public Health Service Issue
Official Health Bulletin
on Influenza.
LATEST WORD ON SUBJECT,
Epidemic Probably Not Spanish In
Origin Germ Still Unknown Peo
ple Should Guard Against "DropU
Infection" Surgeon General Blue,
Makes Authoritative Statement.
Washington, D. C (Special.) A4-
though King Alfonso of Spain waaj
one of the victim of the Influensa epi
demic in 1808 and again this summer,
Spanish authorities repudiate aaj
claim to influenza r.s a "Spanish" dis
ease. If the people of this country do
not take care the epidemic will be
come so widespread throughout the)
United States that soon we shall heu
the disease called "American" lufl.u-(
enm.
In response to a request for definite)
Information concerning Spanish lnflu
enza. Surgeon General Itupert Blue of
the V. S. Public Health Service has
authorized the following official lnter
view :
What Is Spanish Influenza? Is If
something new? Does it come from
Spain?
"The disease now occurring In tlU;
country and culled 'Spanish Influent
za resembles a very contagious ktml
of 'cold,' accompanied by fever, pains
Coughs and Sneezes
Spread Diseases
As Dangerous as Haison G sa Shell
In the head, eyes, ears, back or other
parts of the body and a feeling of Se
vere sickness. In most of the cases the)
symptoms disappear after three or four
days, the patient then rapidly recorer
I ng. Some of the patients, however,'
develop pneumonia, or inllammatlon
of the ear, or meningitis, and many of,
these complicated cases die. Whether
this so-called 'Spanish' Influenza le
identical with the epidemics of Influen
za of earlier years Is not yet known.
"Epidemics of Influenza have visited
this country since 1017. It Is Interest
ing to know that this first epidemic
was brought here from Valencia,
Spain. Since that time there have
been numerous epidemics of the dis
ease. In 18S0 and 1S90 an epidemic
of influenza, starting somewhere In the
Orient, spread first to Russia and
thence over practically the entire civ
ilized world. Three years later there
was another flare-up of the disease.
Both times the epidemic spread wide
ly over the United States.
"Although the present epidemic is
called 'Spanish Influenza.' there Is no
reason to believe that it originated in
Spain. Somo writers who have studied
the question believe that the epidemic
came from the Orient and they call at
tention to the fact that t lie Germans
mention the disease us occurring along
the eastern front In the summer and
fall of 1917."
How can "Spanish influenza" be rec
ognized? "There Is as yet no certain way In
which a single case of 'Spanish Influ
enza' can be recognized. On the oth
er hand, recognition Is easy where
there Is a group of cases. In contrast
to the outbreaks of ordinary coughs
and colds, which usually occur In the
cold months, epidemics of influenza
may occur at any season of the year.
Thus the present epidemic raged most
intensely in Europe In May, .lime and
July. Moreover, In the cose of ordi
nary colds, tiie general symptoms
(fever, pain, depression) nre by no
means as severe or as sadden In their
onset ns they are In inflnensa. Final
ly, ordinary colds do not spread
through the community so rapidly oe
so extensively as does Influenza.
"In most cases n person taken sick
with Influenza feels sick rather sud
denly. He feels weak, has pains In the
eyes, ears, head or back, and may he
sore all over. Many patients feel
dizzy, some vomit. Most of the pa
tients complain of feeling chilly, and
with this comes a fever In which the
temperature rises to 100 to 101. In
most cases the pulse remains relative-,

most notable feat of arms ever

cessful conclusion. The advance

motor car by way of La Capede
four miles from the Trelong road

HOLD YOUR LIBERTY BONOS.
Some get-rich quick concerns
are endeavoring to persuade pa
triotic Liberty bond holders,
whom they know will not sell
outright their Liberty bonds, to
turn over their Liberty bonds to
these companies as security for
a loan and with the money thus
borrowed purchase stock in their
companies.
A Liberty loan bond is the
safest investment in the world,
and a prudent man will very
carefully investigate any effort
to induce him to exchange it for
a less safe investment. This
lending one money on Liberty
bonds in many cases is only a
thinly disguised method of ex
changing security to purchase
stock in the lenders company
for stock of doubtful value for
Liberty bonds of unquestioned
value.
It is a good business and it is
patriotism to hold your Liberty
bonds.
FOUND CONDITIONS FINE.
Dr. J. T. Binkley, from the of
fice of the surgeon general of
the United States is visiting No
gales and is making a investiga
tion of health conditions, par
ticularly in the cantonments.
He found conditions here fine
and influenza situation all that
could be expected. What few
mild cases there are among tbe
soldiers are coming on fine and
tbe doctor was much pleased
with health conditions here both
in the military camp and with
the civilian population. Oasis.

Life
Was a
Misery
Mrs. F. M. Jones, of
Palmer, Okla., writes:
"From the time I en
tered into womanhood
... 1 looked with dread
from one month to the
next. I suffered with my
back and bearing-down
pain, until life to me was
a misery. 1 would think
1 could not endure the
pain any longer, and I
gradually got worse. . .
Nothing seemed to help
me until, one day, . . .
1 decided to
TAKE
The Woman's Tonic
"I took four bottles,"
Mrs. Jones goes on to
say, "and was not only
greatly relieved, but can
truthfully say that I have
not a pain. . .
" It has now been two
years since I tookCardai,
and I am still in good
health. . . I would ad
vise any woman or girl
to use Cardui who is a
sufferer from any female
trouble."
If you suffer pain caused
from womanly trouble, or
if you feel the need of a
good strengthening tonic
to build up yourrun-do wn
system, take the advice
of Mrs. Jones. Try Car
dui. It helped her. We
believe it wHl help you.
