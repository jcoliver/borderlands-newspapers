The Spirit of Friendship.
This store looks upon its patrons not
merely as customers but as friends.
People purchase here because they
have friendly feeling for this store.
The cause which develops this friendly
feeling, may differ, in fact, they are
sure to differ. One's friendship for
the store is the result of finding good
values; another's is the result of effi
cient service and courteous treatment,
and so on.
Naturally this friendshiply feeling on
the part of our patrons is reciprocated
on our part. And this spirit of mutual
friendship is an impetus for greater
service and an incentive to ever-increasing
endeavor to make this store
a place where every visitor will feel
perfectly at home.

ciation naving left the countv

was elected president.
It was decided to hold a fair
on Thursday, Friday and Satur
day, Sept 25th, 26th and 27th
A committee to prepare a pre
mium list for the fair was pro

fees from entrance moneys, there
will be a handsome fund to pay
expenses, including an attrac
tive premium list, with liberal
purses lor races, sports, etc.
It will be the biggest and most
attractive fair yet held in Santa
Cruz county.

AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION.
There are a number of cases
of typhoid fever in Tucson. Just
that number too many. Typhoid
is caused by a germ, which is
usually distributed through in
fected milk, water and by flies.
The water of the city wells
should be carefully tested at
short intervals for the typhoid
bacillus. The milk supplies
should be tested and if the geim
is found the typhoid carrier
should be removed from the
dairy and placed where be can
not infect others. The fly should
always be swatted on general
principles; and both water and
milk boiled before using, until
all danger of infection is passed.
The residents of this city have
a right to know when serious
diseases are prevalent, in order
to protect themselves. Typhoid
is preventable with a little care.

PROPERTY BOUGHT.
August Brodine, mining man
of Patagonia formerly of Colo
rado has bought from George
Wieland and J. W. Wilson a
group of four claims in the Pa
tagonia mountains. Originally
these claims were the western
extension of the Buffalo group
and were taken under bond and
lease by Mr. Brodine a year ago,
since which time development
work has been prosecuted, re
sulting in the development of a
good body of ore carrying silver,
gold aud copper. Mr. Brodine
made final payment on the prop
erty last week. Most of the
work at this camp has been done
on the Golden Rose claim, and
Mr. Brodine and the men inter
ested with him are satisfied with
the outlook at this property,
feeling confident that the money
expended in development work
will be returned many times
over as production increases.

THE NORMAL SCHOOL.
At a recent joint meeting of
the Board of Education of the
Tempe Normal School of Ari
zona and the Northern Arizona
Normal steps were taken, which
will be of greatest importance
to parents contemplating send
ing their children to the Normal
School.
After Aug. 15, 1919, no stud
ents will be admitted to either
state normal school until Che.v
have completed one year pf high
school work, and after August
15, 1920, it will be necessary
that they have two years of high
school preparation, before en
trance into either normal school.
This action was taken aftar
careful consideration by the
Boards of Education and the
State Board. It has been re
commended several times by the
state legislature but was post
poned from year to year on ac
count of the scarcity of high
schools in the state. It is now
believed that the high schools
are so numerous and that the
special provision for establish
ing two year high school courses
in rural communities will ad
equately provide for at least two
years of high school work. It
was necessary, however, to drop
one year at a time in order that
no injustice might be done to
students who are now attending
either one of the state normal
schools.

the week from a visit to their
company's holdings in Coman
che and Eastland counties, where
they made a personal inspection
of their property. Both were
greatly pleased with their visit,
and since returning home, have
been advising their personal
friends to invest in Southwest
Ranger Oil and Refining Co.
stock. Drilling will commence
in the very near future on what
is claimed to be "sure shot
gusher land." It is the inten
tion to let two drilling contracts
on a fifty-fifty basis. They say
in the Desdemona field visited,
many new producing wells and
gushers are coming in daily.
Stockholders in the S. R. O. and
R. C. are to be congratulated.
All should make big money on
their investment.
