In time of peace Germany was
the largest consumer of tung
sten ore, and it is probable that
when peace succeeds war Ger
many will again require a large
amount of the ore. Although
Great Britain has taken steps to
reduce tungsten ores at home,
she is unable to get the desired
ore supply to keep the works
employed, and the present out
look is that not only will the
prsnt price be maintained, but
it is thought likely that it may
be somewhat higher. Mining

Mineral Park, Mohave county,
has a. population that puts a
limit on practical jokes. Recent
ly a bomb with a lighted and
sputtering fuse was thrown into
a pool hall where quite a num
ber of, men were congregated.
Some time later the culprit was
capturned and after a hasty trial
he was sentenced to be spanked.
The victim was placed face
downward on a bench and the
men took turns in administering
the remedy with a board. That
the bomb was only a fake sim

The state senate has reported
favorably in committee of the
whole on the Florence bridge
bill, which carries an appropria
tion of $50,000 for the recon
struction of a crossing over - the
Gila river opposite the town of
Florence. The state built a
bridge over the river at this
point in 1910, but last year dur
ing tne heavy noous trie river
abandoned the old channel and
cut a new channel south of the
bridge, leaving the latter struc

the river back again into the

The Grand Canyon National Park.
In response to a general de
mand that a National Park be
created at the Grand Canyon in
Arizona, Honorable Carl Hayden
has introduced in the House a
carefully prepared bill the enact
rnent of which will acomplish
this purpose. The bill provides
that certain lands now included
within the Grand Canyon Na
tional Monument shall be set
aside and dedicated as a public
park for the benefit and enjoy -ment
of the people under the
name of the Gmnd Canyon Na
tional Park.
The area of the present mon
ument is 1,260 square miles but
the proposed park will contain
only 996 squares so that 61 sec
tions of land that are now with
drawn from all forms of entry
will be made available for graz
ing and others uses. It is the
intention of the bill that nothing
but the scenic portions of the
Canyon with sufficient areas back
from the rim to permit the con
struction of roads shall be in
cluded within the National Park.
In order to be sure that the
boundaries of the proposed Na
tional Park will be entirely satis
factory to all concerned Con
gressman Hayden has forwarded
maps showing its limits to the
Board of Supervisors of Cocon-
I ino county for their approval
before the bill is considered by
congress.
Section 2 of the bill provides
that the Grand Canyon Nation
al Park shall be administered by
the secretary of the interior in
accordance with the national
park service act which became a
law last year. This law autho
rizes grazing permits to be issued
but such a comparatively small
area of grazing land is included
within the park that only a few
permits will be necessary.
The Hayden bill fully protects
the interests of those who have
heretofore acquired property
rights within the proposed park.
Provision is made for the devel
opment of water power under
existing laws and the secretary,
of the interior is authorized to
permit mining whenever con
sistent with the primary purpo
ses of the park. The United
States reclamation service is
also granted the right to con
struct reservoirs whenever
necessary.
It is believed that by the esta
blishment cf a national park at
the Grand Canyon the way will
be paved for securing appropria
tions by congress for the con
struction of roads and trails
which will make the canyon
much more accessible to visitors.
Over 100,000 tourists visited the
Grand Canyon in 1915 but an
even larger number are certain
to come each year, particularly
if good roads are constructed so
that automobiles cn drive along
the rim and view the greatest
natural wonder in the world.

ARIZONA COPPER.
Arizona's production of copper
in 1916 reached the staggering
figure of 675,000,000 pounds, re
presenting approximately a value
of $190,000,000. This is over
50,000,060 pounds more than the
total production of the two next
largest producing states, Mon
tana and Michigan.
The progress of Arizona in the.
production of copper is without
a parallel. The first available
record of production was in 1883,
and ten years ago the produc
tion was 117,000 pounds. With
the rapid development now un

what the production will be a

The new 640-acre law permits
all of those qualified to enter
lands under the same to imme
diately make application for the
same at the United States dis
trict land office in which these
lands are located, notwithstand
ing the fact that it is the .duty
of the secretary of the interior
to finally designate the public
lands that may be entered, which
are lands "the surface of which
is, in his opinion, chiefly valu
able for grazing and raising for
age crops, do not contain mer
chantable timber, are not sus
ceptible of irrigation from any
known source of water supply,
and are of such a character that
610 acres are reasonably re
quired for the support of a fami
ly, and that said lands are non
mineral in character. That said
lands contain no "water holes"
for watering livestock, and that
said lands are not situated in or
on any driveway, but are near to
well defined public roads and
trails.
The law provides additional
entries to four classes of persons
who have made former home
stead entries of land of the same
class as are to be designated
under'the new 610 acre law.
First A former homestead
entry of the character above
described may make additional
entry of a tract within twenty
miles from former entry, which
together with former entry, shall
not exceed 640 acres; Provided
that all contiguous areas are
entered prior to areas that do
not join the former.
Second A former homestead
entryman who has not submitted
final proof of his existing entry
has an additional right to enter
contiguous lands making 640
acres in the aggregate. N re
sidence is required on the con
tiguous additional lands, but im
provements must be made on the
additional entry, equal to $1.25
per acre.
Third A former homestead
entryman who has proved up on
a tract of land of the character
permitted under the 640 acre law
and who still owns and resides
thereon, may make additional
entry to contiguous or adjoining
lands designated for entry under
this act, which, together with
the amount of land embraced in
his original entry, will not ex
ceed 640 acres. Improvements
to the extent of $1.25 per acre
on the additional entry are re
quired. No residence required
on the additional.
Fourth A former homestead
entryman who has heretofore
made entry of lands of the char-
acted described in the new law
of less than 640 acses; and no
land of the same character ad
joins or lies within twenty miles
may relinquish his entry to the
government and in lieu thereof
may enter 640 acres anywhere
in the same land district wherein
his original entry was made.
Preferential rights All for
mer homestead entrymen who
have heretofore entered lands
as above described and entitled
to make additional entries that
are of the same character of
lands that are provided for in
the 640-acre law (and recollect
these lands must be of the same
class) have ninety days prefer
ence right altar the secretary
of the interior has finally desig
nated lands adjoining these for
mer homestead entries as stock
raising lands, within which to
appear and make entry on con
tiguous or adjoining lands.
Those making original applica
tions should have in mind rights
of homesteaders who have taken
up lands adjoining stock raising
lands. Before you make ap
plication be sure you know the
lands you have selected do not
contain tracts which adjoin en
trymen who have ninety days
preferential right, as in all prob
ability those former entrymen
will use their preferential right,
and thus take from you the por
tions to which he is entitled.
Under the present ruling any
person who has had or who now
has a homestead in the Forest
Reserve is not entitled to the
benefits of the stockmens home
stead law.
In taking up original home
steads under the 640 acre stock
raising homestead law the entry
man must comply with the re
gular homestead laws with the
exception of cultivation. He
must reside on the land for seven
months out of ten for the period
of three years and put improve
ments on the land to the value
of $1. 25 per acre.
The fees to be paid to the
United States Land Office are as
follows:
610 acres single minimum land
would be $24 plus $10, $34.
640 double minimum land
would be $18 plus $10, $58.
320 acres single minimum land
$22.
320 acres double minimum land
$34.
160 acres single minimum land
$16.
160 acres double minimum laud
$22.
The filing of the petition and
application and acceptance of
the same by the district land
office does not give the right of
occupancy of the land, the land
cannot be occupied until it has
been segregated by the secretary
of the interior, but the lands are
withdrawn aDd held suspended
from all other entries pending
the action of the secretary.
All petitions and abplications
must be made in duplicate form.
WESTWARD HO!
General Fred Funston "has
gone West," -as is the saying on
European battlefields. His loss
to the nation will be as keenly
felt as it is keenly regret
ted, but his fame is secure.
He cut his own niche in the tem
ple of the famous. Throughout
his career, he bore the colors of
the citizenry as opposed to the
trained military man, and the
country has intently watched
him rise from colonel to major
general, but major general does
not measuse his rank in popular
estimation. He was one of the
people's ideals. Rejected at
West Point because be failed to
pass the entrance examination,
he started at the bottom and
fought up to the top. He forced
recognition from a none too
sympathetic army administra
tion composed of West Pointers,
and the people were his strong
est advocates for promotion,
because he was essentially one
of them. No American soldier
since Grant has held a higher
place in the esteem of the un
military American people, and
one has a feeling that his un
timely cutting off anticipated the
meeting of the man and the
emergency which would have
added further glory to his ca
reer. The west was proud of
Funston because he was a west
erner and he seemed the embodi
ment of those traits on which
westerners put a premium, man
liness, courage, liberality and
catholicity. Nowhere will sor
row be keener than among the
rank and file of the army. Death
has touched the nation in a ten
der spot. Arizona Daily Star.

BONE DRY BILL.
Measure Now Ready For President
Wilson's Signature.
Washington, Feb. 21. Absol
ute prohibition legislation took
its longest forward stride in the
nation's history today when the
house, after two hours of up
roarious debate, approved by a
four to one majority a senate
measure which would raise an
ironclad barrier against importa
tion of liquor into prohibition
states. It is expected to receive
the approval of President Wil
son within a week, adding im
mediately to the "bone dry"
territory about one-third of con
tinental United States.
The provision is regarded as
the most far reaching that could
be enacted by the federal govern
nient, and as sweeping as would
be possible under any method
short of a national prohibition
amendment. It would cut off
entirely liquor importations am
ounting now to millions of dol
lars annually into the larg num
ber of states which have forbid
den manufacture or sale but
have permitted importation for
personal use.
Advocates of prohibition were
divided among themselves over
the expediency of the step, some
friends of the cause declaring so
drastic a law would have a re
actionary effect. In the same
way those who have opposed
prohibition were not unanimous
in operation when the vote was
taken. The roll call brought
cheers and cries of "bone dry"
from all parts of the house, how
ever, and the result was greeted
with a noisy demonstration. The
vote, as officially announced,
was 321 to 72, a re check of the
roll changed it to 316 to 72.
Party lines were completely
broken down and numerous re
presentatives for prohibition
states were recorded in the ne
gative. So large a vote is sel
dom recorded on any measure.
Dry advocates were jubilant
tonight. Representative Webb of
North Carolina, father of the
resolution for a national prohi
bition amendment, declared the
overwhelming affirmative vote
had killed the state's rights ar
gument and that the national
amendment, already reported
favorably, certainly would pass
the house at this session. The
national legislative committee
of the Anti Saloon league issued
a statement saying today's ac
tion had "cleared the decks" for
the national amendment.
Many of the wet advocates in
congress, particularly those with
brewers among their consti
tuents, also declared themselves
much pleased with the outcome.
The brewers are understood to
have been in favor of the pro
vision, both because it would
curtail the so-called mail order
business carried on by houses
dealing in spirituous liquors and
because it might prevent states
now wet from going dry, and
indefinitely postpone nation-wide
prohibition.
Distillers and whiskey deal
ers, on the other hand, were
vigorously opposed to this pro
posal. There are at this time,
Representative Shirley of Ken
tucky testified during debate,
more than 228,000,000 gallons of
liquor in bond in the United
States and 40 per cent of such
liquor heretofore has been sold
in partially dry territory. Under
the amendment concurred in to
day all of this must be sold in
absolutely wet territory, prob
ably, he argued, at a great loss.
Mr. Shirley made a futile at
tempt to amend the proposal by
extending the time when it would
go into force for one year.
In several states the Reed
amendment would anticipate ac
tion by the state legislatures.
Arkansas, Arizona, Idaho, Mon
tana, Oregon, Tennessee and
Washington all have "bone dry"
laws already in operation or to
become effective shortly. Utah
has enacted a law effective Au
gust 1; the legislatures of Kan
sas and South Dakota have sent
"bone dry" bills to their gov
ernors for signature.
"Bone dry" measures are pend
ing with some prospect of pass
age in Colorado, Iowa, Missis
sippi, South Carolina, North Gar
olina, Oklahoma ana Micnigan
and a "bone dry" measure for
Alaska has been favorably re
ported in congress. Of all the
southern states liquor could be
sent into only four under the
federal regulation. They are
Florida, Louisiana, Texas and
Kentucky which, with about a
score of other local option states,
will be affected in no way. It is
pointed out that the amendment
will not operate to bar shipments
into dry territory in local option
states, referring only to states
entirely dry.
CAPTAIN BONSALL DEAD.
Last Sunday afternoon, Capt.
N. F. Bonsall, father of Mrs. S.
F. Noon, of this city, passed
away at the home of one of his
daughters in Houston, Texas,
where he had been visiting.
Deceased was well and favor

he and his family resided, when
he was a passenger conductor
on the Sonora railway, between
Nogales and Guaycuas.
His daughter, Mrs. Noon, was

end came, she having been sum
moned last week by telegraph.
Thti funeral was held last

Bonsall will be missed.
MONKEY SPRINGS.
The Herald of Thursday says:
"O. F. Ashburn of the Pata
gonia neighborhood is planning
to build a large hotel and dauc
ing pavilion at Monkey Springs
on his ranch near Patagonia. In
other words a first class summer
resort will be the new feature of
that progressive neighborhood.
"A short time ago Mr. Ash
burn was suffering with rheuma
tism. So great was his suffer
ings that he decided to go to a
large and noted hot springs for
treatment. Upon second thought
he took a series of baths in Mon
key Springs which is on his
rauch and the bubbling hot wat
er soon put an end to his rheu
matism. So complete was the
cure that he decided to give the
public the benefit of the hot
springs."
SOLELIAC GOES TO GUAYMAS.
Captain Louis Soleliac, who
with John Hughes and J. G.

ly leased the Albin Hotel at
Guaymas, went to Guaymas
Thursday.
The handsome big hotel is be
ing renovated and refurnished
throughout under the personal
supervision of Mr. Willoughby,
who is an experienced hotel
man. He engaged in the busi

to Nogales.
In a letter to a friend here,
Mr. Willoughby, who went to
Guaymas last week, says:
"Everything lovely here. Busi

better. When in Guaymas, don't

A BIGGER SANTA RITA.
Work upon the building of a
new wing for the Santa Rita
hotel, together with remodeling
and other general improvements
to the present building, at a cost
of from $175,000 to $200,000, is
to be begun within the next two
weeks, according to Louie Ieager,
proprietor of the hotel, says
yesterday's Tucson Star.
Iaeger has just returned from
San Praucisco, where he spent
a week complething arrangments
for the proposed improvements.
He brought to Tucson with him
Architect Curiett, of Los An
geles, who is busy sketching
preliminary plans.
The extra wing will be added
at the south side of the present
building, and will contain 160
rooms, according to Mr. Iaeger.
A contract for the excavation
work and construction is expect
ed to be let by the end of next
week.
"The new building will be
Class A concrete structure, of
reinforced concrete," said Iaeger,
"It will contain 160 rooms, which
will give the hotel a total capa
city of more than 300 rooms.
This will enable me to keep pace
with the rapid growth of Tucson,
and take care of the tourist and
business trade here for the next
ten years to come.
"I estimate that the improve
ments and new building will cost
me from $175,000 to $200,000."

Arizona Engineers to Organize.
Most Arizona engineers, be
cause of the distance from cent
ers of population, have found it
difficult or impossible to enjoy
the revivifying and stimulating
effects of attendance at meetings
of national engineering societies.
This fact, together with a desire
to study the peculiar problems
and advance the interests of en
gineers of Arizona, New Mexico
and Texas, has led to the forma
tion of the South western Society
of Engineers which will hold its
first convention in El Paso,
March 8, 9 and 10. An interest
ing technical program has been
arranged, and the social features
of this gathering promise to be
very enjoyable.
The proceedings of the Society
will be published, and other ad
vantages than those mentioned
will accrue to members. The
dues have been made compara
tively low, and applications for
charter membership will be re
ceived up to the time of the con

GENERAL FUNSTON DEAD.
Beloved Army Officer's Untimely Pass
ing Mourned by Nation.
San Antonio, Feb. 19. Major
General Frederick Funston, com
mander of the southern depart
ment, U. S. A., since February,
1915, died suddenly at a hotel
here tonight a few minutes after
he had finished dinner. He col
lapsed while seated in the lobby
of ths hotel talking with friends,
aad was playing with little Inez
Silverberg, of Des Moines, Iowa,
a guest with her parents, at the
hotel, when he fell unconscious.
Death was almost instantaneous.
Gen. Funston was 51 years old.
Ever since March, 1916, when
he was placed in command of all
United States forces on the Mex
ican border, General Funston
had worked at an unusual pace.
At critical times in border de
velopments he frequently re
mained on duty 24 hours. The
handling of regulars disposed at
various stations on the border,
the Pershing expedition and, of
late, rearrangement of regular
troops while providing for the
return of National guardsmen,
have entailed an enormous am
ount of detail work orobably ex
ceeding that which fell to any
commanding general of the Unit
ed States army since the civil
war. Only today Gen. Funston
completed orders for the return
of the last of the guardsmen.
Washington, Feb. 19. Major
General Funston's sudden death
came as a great shock to high
officials of the army and Pre
sident Wilson. He was one of
the distinguished commanders of
the service and one of whom
greater things were expected in
the future. The youngest major
general of the line, vigorous and
apparently healthy, he had been
counted on by his superiors for
many more years of active ser
vice. The news reached the war de
partment late tonight in a brief
despatch from the headquarters
of the southern department. It
was telephoned to Secretary
Baker's home, where a dinner
was being given to the presi
dent, with most of the ranking
army officers in Washington
among the guests.
"General Funston's death is a
loss to the army and a loss to the
country. During the trouble
on the Mexican border his work
has been difficult, exacting and
delicate. His conduct has been
that of a soldier and he has ex
emplified the high tradition of
the American army by his quick,
intelligent and effective action.
Throughout it all the sympathy
between General Funston and
the department has been com
plete and no shadow of disagree
ment has arisen.
"I am deeply grieved person
ally at his death and feel that
his loss to the country is very
great."
Major General Pershing, who
has been in command of the El
Paso district since the withdraw
al of the American expedition
from Mexico, automatically will
succeed to the duties of com
mander of the southern depart
ment until an appointment has
been made. Recently made a
major general, he is the only
officer of that rank now assigned
to the department.
As immediate successor to the
command, General Pershing will
have charge of the many details
of the movement of the remain
ing units of the national guard
ordered from the border last
Saturday. It is expected here
that this movement, . plans for
which were worked out by Gen
eral Funston as virtually his
last military duty, will go for
ward without interruption.
NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS.
Notice is hereby given that
the annual meeting of stock
holders of The African Land and
Irrigation Company, will be held
on Monday, March 5th, 1917, in

According to the new fish and
game law of Arizona, it is now
unlawful to take any kind offish
without a license. Formerly,
only bass and trout were pro
tected, but it is now illegal to
ta.hu any kind of fish. There is
no closed season on any except
trout, however.
Every copppr mine in the
state is producing ;tt maximum
capacity, employing every man
for whom it can find a place un
derground and every smeller is
treating every pound of ore pos
sible. So great has been the
demand for miners and so attrac
tive the wages that the coul in
dustry of the west is said to be
suffering a shortage of miners
for the reason that so many coal
miners have become "hard rock
men" in the copper mines.

It Always Helps
says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky.f in
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. Alter taking three bottles
of Cardui, I beg?.n to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
mm
&3 fe m&gjzjr
a trial. I still use Cardui when I feel a
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the voman's
Ionic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
