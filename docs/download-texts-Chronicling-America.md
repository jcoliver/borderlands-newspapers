# Downloading content from Chronicling America

See script called download-pages.py

In the JSON response, each element in 'items' is effectively a page, and that page number is stored in the 'sequence' element. The date of publication is formatted at YYYYMMDD and is in the 'date' element. Could use a file naming convention that is:
date-sequence.txt.
**Question:** Do we care about situations where the number of pages in a single issue is greater than nine? These may cause changes when sorting files...
date-1.txt
date-2.txt
...
date-10.txt

**Question:** Do we want to create documents that are entire volumes? That is create a single text file with the text for an entire day's paper. If so, do these live in the same folder? These would then be named date.txt. This could be done after download occurs.

In conversations with LoC folks, there is an API for all records for a particular title:

https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?lccn=sn95060694&dateFilterType=yearRange&date1=1789&date2=1963&language=&ortext=&andtext=&phrasetext=&proxtext=&proxdistance=5&rows=10&searchType=advanced&sort=date&format=json

https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?lccn=sn95060694&dateFilterType=yearRange&date1=1789&date2=1963&proxdistance=5&rows=10&searchType=advanced&sort=date&format=json

Taking this apart:
base url: https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/
lccn: sn95060694
dateFilterType=yearRange
date1=1789
date2=1963
proxdistance=5
rows=10
searchType=advanced
sort=date
format=json

This returns a json object with 10 records (rows=10). Each record contains the actual ocr in an element named ocr_spa (for spanish language texts) and ocr_eng (for english language texts). We could download things this way, grabbing the ocr_[spa|eng] element from the json object. There are 11116 records for this title, so would need to pagenate through records with the `page` key. i.e. the URL above returns the first 10 records in the json object (`rows=10`); to get rows 11-20, add `&page=2`.

Using
```
query = "https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?lccn=sn95060694&dateFilterType=yearRange&date1=1789&date2=1963&proxdistance=5&rows=10&searchType=advanced&sort=date&format=json"
response = urllib.urlopen(query)
data = json.loads(response.read())
```
The returned `data` is a dictionary with the following top elements:

+ totalItems
+ endIndex
+ startIndex
+ itemsPerPage
+ items

The good stuff is in the items element. We can extract the OCR text of the _second_ item in the list via:
```
print data['items'][2]['ocr_spa']
```
